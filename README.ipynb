    "# Maximum Independent Set\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository holds a solution to a problem, which can be reconstructed as a maximum independent set problem, which I was tasked to solve. Two versions of the code are provided - one with comments, and one without. The remainder of this README is a section of the report I wrote for this problem and my corresponding solution.\n",
    "Note that the initial report was written in LaTeX and now converted to Markdown so Github can display it. This means that e.g. line numbers will not make as much sense.\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "I was tasked with solving a specific algorithmic problem, inspired by a real life scenario. The problem was introduced as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The municipal administration of Nijmegen wants to keep the city clean and neat. In order to do this, they want to place garbage bins on as many street intersections as possible.  This means the garbage collectors have to make more stops on their daily routes, something they are not happy about.\n",
    ">After discussion between the city and the garbage collectors a compromise has been reached: the city will place as many garbage bins as possible, but if two intersections are adjacent to each other at most one of them will have a garbage bin.\n",
    ">They have asked [sic] if it is possible to place all the bins in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraint specifying that two adjacent intersections may not both have a garbage bin will be referred to as the non-adjacency constraint from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "Input to the program is given via **stdin**, in the following format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "8 7 4\n",
    "1 2\n",
    "1 4\n",
    "2 3\n",

    "5 7\n",
    "6 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first line contains integers $n\\ (1 \\leq n \\leq 200)$, $m\\ (1 \\leq m \\leq 100)$ and $b\\ (1 \\leq b \\leq 20)$. These values correspond to the number of streets, intersections and bins to be placed respectively.\n",
    "All subsequent lines correspond to a street that exists between the intersections identified by the given integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "Output should be given via **stdout**. The program should either output `possible` or `impossible`, depending on whether it's possible for $b$ bins to be placed on the $m$ intersections, without breaking the condition stating that two bins may never be placed on adjacent intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Transformation\n",
    "In order to start looking for solutions to this problem, we must first consider potential data structures to represent the given information. %Several representations exist, each with their own up- and downsides. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum number of bins\n",
    "If we consider:\n",
    "$G = (V, E)$, with $V$ as the set of intersections and $E$ as the set of streets connecting these intersections, $\\#b(G)$ as the number of bins that can be placed on graph G without breaking the non-adjacency constraint, $Adj[v]$ as the set of neighbours of some vertex v, then the following must hold:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\#b((V, E)) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\quad \\text{iff a bin is placed on arbitrary vertex }p\\text{:}\\\\\n",
    "1 + \\#b((V - p - Adj[p], E- \\{(x, y) | x \\in E \\land y \\in E \\land x \\in \\{p\\} \\cup Adj[p] \\land y \\in \\{p\\} \\cup Adj[p]\\}))\\\\\n",
    "\\quad \\text{iff no bin is placed on arbitrary vertex }p\\text{:}\\\\\n",
    "\\#b((V - p, E - \\{(p, y) | y \\in E\\} - \\{(x, p) | x \\in E\\}))\\\\\n",
    "\\quad \\text{iff no arbitrary vertex }p\\text{ exists:}\\\\\n",
    "0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In words, the number of bins that can be placed on the graph without breaking the non-adjacency constraint is either:\n",
    "* the number of bins that can be placed on the subgraph excluding arbitrary vertex $p$ and its neighbours, plus one, **iff** we choose $p$ to have a bin.\n",
    "    We can plus one because we have given $p$ a bin in this case.\n",
    "* the number of bins that can be placed on the subgraph excluding arbitrary vertex $p$, **iff** we choose $p$ to not have a bin.\n",
    "    We simply reduce the set we recurse with in this case. \n",
    "* zero, if there are no vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it becomes apparent that working with the $G = (V, E)$ representation is going to be unnecessarily inefficient in an algorithm, as we would have to update $E$ for all recursive calls. However, this is not needed. We know that the only use for E in the previous equation is in $Adj[v]$, to find the set of adjacent vertices for some vertex $v$. If we consider $U$ to be a set of vertices that only existed in a supergraph of $V$, then the following holds:\n",
    "$$\\forall p:V, V - Adj[p] = V - (Adj[p] \\cup \\{u | u \\in U \\land u \\notin V\\})$$\n",
    "So, if we keep the vertices that should no longer be considered within E, then $Adj[p]$ may return more vertices, but as none of these vertices are in $V$, there is no difference between reducing E and not doing so. This saves us a step.\n",
    "So, we can use a set representation, where $G = \\{v_0, v_1, ..., v_m\\}$, and $\\forall v:G, Adj[v]$ is defined to be the set of adjacent vertices for the initial graph. This allows us to simplify $\\#b(G)$ greatly:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\#b(G) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\quad \\text{iff a bin is placed on arbitrary vertex }p\\text{:}\\\\\n",
    "1 + \\#b(G - p - Adj[p])\\\\\n",
    "\\quad \\text{iff no bin is placed on arbitrary vertex }p\\text{:}\\\\\n",
    "\\#b(G - p)\\\\\n",
    "\\quad \\text{iff no arbitrary vertex }p\\text{ exists:}\\\\\n",
    "0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want to maximize $\\#b(G)$, we can compare the results from both options to decide whether we want to place a bin on $p$. We can simply choose the higher value of the two:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\#b(G) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\quad \\text{iff arbitrary vertex }p\\text{ exists:}\\\\\n",
    "max(1 + \\#b(G - p - Adj[p]), \\#b(G - p))\\\\\n",
    "\\quad \\text{iff no arbitrary vertex }p\\text{ exists:}\\\\\n",
    "0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "At this point the concept has been reduced such that only few set difference operations are required, however it is still quite inefficient as it uses multiple recursion. The worst case scenario for this equation would be $m$ vertices, without any edges. So, $\\forall v:G, Adj[v] = \\emptyset$, which means the parameter for both recursive calls is $G - p$, and hence the equation would have $O(2^m)$ time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these cases may be discarded, and we can use strategies to improve the running time of this concept. I will go over my optimization steps in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization\n",
    "In this section I will start with the following code sample, which was shown to be correct in the previous section. Over the course of this section I will improve this code sample by pruning some cases.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">   def hash_b(self, vertices: \"Set['Vertex']\") -> int:\n",
    ">       if len(vertices) == 0:\n",

    "```\n",
    "The recursive call in the first parameter of the `max` function will be referred to as the first case, and the second recursive call will be referred to as the second case from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Case pruning\n",
    "We can extend our base case `if len(vertices) == 0: return 0` by the case where vertices contains just one vertex. In this case, we can always place a bin on this vertex, and never recurse further. Hence, if `len(vertices) == 1`, then we should return 1. We can combine this with the existing base case to:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def hash_b(self, vertices: \"Set['Vertex']\") -> int:\n",
    ">       if len(vertices) <= 1:\n",

    "                   self.hash_b(vertices))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early Termination\n",
    "The algorithm will go through all recursive cases, even if we would already be able to conclusively say that placing $b$ bins is possible halfway through. We want to avoid this, and stop immediately when we know we can place $b$ bins.\n",
    "We can do this by incrementing a class attribute `self.cur` before recursing via the first case, and decrementing afterwards. This way, this `self.cur` attribute will always be the value that gets added to the result of the current `hash_b` call, to get the final amount of bins that can be placed.\n",
    "Using this `self.cur`, we can at any point calculate the return value of the initial call to `hash_b`, and find out if we can stop all recursion right now.\n",
    "If the value resulting from the first case plus this `self.cur` is larger than the amount of bins to be placed, then we can stop all recursions and return:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def hash_b(self, vertices: \"Set['Vertex']\") -> int:\n",
    "        if len(vertices) <= 1:\n",
    "            return len(vertices)\n",

    ">       self.cur -= 1\n",
    ">       return max(first, self.hash_b(vertices))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that only the first case can increment the result, so this method of pruning only works for this case, and not the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Halfway Pruning\n",
    "Not always do we need to calculate the second case. We only care about this case when its result may be larger than `first`. Hence, all cases where we can conclusively say that it will not be can be discarded.\n",
    "The best case scenario for the second case is if all remaining vertices are nonadjacent. In this case the result will be equal to the length of the set of vertices. If `first` is already larger than or equal to the length of the set of vertices, then `max(first, second)` is equivalent to `first`. So, we won't need to calculate the second case anymore.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def hash_b(self, vertices: \"Set['Vertex']\") -> int:\n",

    "### Few Neighbour Pruning\n",
    "If `picked` has no neighbours still in `vertices`, then the set used to recurse in the first case will be the same set as the one used in the second case. The difference is that the first case results in a value exactly 1 higher than the second case. In this case, we should ignore the second case.\n",
    "Moreso, if `picked` has exactly one neighbour still in `vertices`, then the second case recurses with a set exactly one vertex larger. Hence, the recursive call from the second case can result in a value 1 higher than the recursive case from the first case. However, because 1 is added to the recursive call for the first case, the result from the second case has an upper bound of `first`. Because we only care about the maximum of the two values, we can ignore the second case when `picked` has exactly one neighbour still in `vertices`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def hash_b(self, vertices: \"Set['Vertex']\") -> int:\n",
    "        if len(vertices) <= 1:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memoization\n",
    "By far the largest optimization technique used is memoization. The input and output of every call to `hash_b` is stored in a cache, and the output from the cache is returned rather than computing the result using the function, if possible. This technique is so useful here is because it's common for `hash_b` to be called with the same set of vertices multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's not as useful for both cases. For instance, during my testing using both provided and generated samples, the second case was responsible for calculating and storing 40.8\\% of everything that was cached, but was only responsible for 8.6\\% of all cache uses. Because of this, it may be worthwhile to only cache the first case. The second case could then either be allowed to use the cache but not store values in the cache, or completely avoid caching altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "My testing showed speed improvements near 2-3\\% for not caching the second case. This would also allow the algorithm to use a decent amount less memory.\n",
    "However, the results were not consistent enough for me to stop caching the second case.\n",

We want this method to be as light as possible, as in `memoize`, the set of vertices is converted to a `frozenset` and hashed before being used for the cache. This hashing of a frozenset will call the `__hash__` method of all elements of the set, and hence also on the `Vertex` objects in our case.\n",
